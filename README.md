# About me

<!--
**Oli677/Oli677** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- I had a brief education in IT but not confident in it so I plan to have a good half-one year period of educating myself untilk i can get a job
- I just switched from Windows to Linux(Ubuntu) and I'm  quite f'n mad about Linux right now
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Linux OS and the bash and Git and Github of course
- After it I plan to learn general computer science, probably get into web development and my personal interest would be C programming
